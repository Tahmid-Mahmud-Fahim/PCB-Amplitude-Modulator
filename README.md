# PCB-Amplitude-Modulator

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a fundamental technique used in communication systems to transmit information via radio waves. By varying the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier wave in accordance with the information signal, AM allows for the efficient broadcasting of audio and other data over long distances. For this assignment, you are tasked with designing an AM modulator circuit that can generate a modulated signal. This problem will provide practical insights into the principles of AM, as well as help you understand the essential components involved in creating a functional modulator circuit.

The AM modulation circuit in (a) can be broken down into two parts: the **AM Generator (b)** and **Amplifier (c)** using two inverting op-amp amplifiers. Your task is to design the PCB. The message signal **Vm** and carrier **Vc** can be generated from a signal generator, and the output AM signal can be monitored using an oscilloscope easily.
